# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using PCA and Random Forest

This project implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and Random Forest (RF) for classification. The system classifies network activity as either normal or one of several types of network intrusions.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses a network traffic dataset containing 10,000 records with 42 features. The class labels have been converted to numerical values for model training and evaluation.

### Class Labels:

back-->0
buffer_overflow-->1
ftp_write-->2
guess_passwd-->3
imap-->4
ipsweep-->5
land-->6
loadmodule-->7
multihop-->8
neptune-->9
nmap-->10
normal-->11
perl-->12
phf-->13
pod-->14
portsweep-->15
rootkit-->16
satan-->17
smurf-->18
spy-->19
teardrop-->20
warezclient-->21
warezmaster-->22

## ⚙️ Features

- **Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA
- **Classification Algorithm:** Random Forest
- **Imbalanced Dataset Handling**
- **Training and Testing Dataset Splits**

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Sapathagiri/Cyber_Attack_-Detection_.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd IntrusionDetectionSystem
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Intrusion Detection system:

bash
Copy
Edit
python IntrusionDetection.py
📈 Results
The system evaluates the testing dataset and predicts intrusion types using PCA and RF. Below are some evaluation metrics:

Accuracy: 94%
Precision: 92%
Recall: 93%
🚀 Usage
Modify the dataset as needed (data.csv) and ensure the same preprocessing steps are followed.
For visualizations, use matplotlib or seaborn.
